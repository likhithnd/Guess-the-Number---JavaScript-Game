# 🎮 Guess the Correct Number – A JavaScript Game

This is a simple interactive number guessing game built using **HTML** and **JavaScript**. The user is prompted to guess a number between 1 and 100. Based on the guess, the program gives hints like "Enter a bigger number" or "Enter a smaller number" until the correct number is guessed.
